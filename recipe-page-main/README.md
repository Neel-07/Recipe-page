## My process
   I began by structuring the HTML to create the recipe page, incorporating sections for ingredients, preparation steps, and images. This involved using semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and good structure. Then, I moved on to styling the page using CSS. I focused on making the recipe page responsive and ensuring it looked visually appealing on different screen sizes.
